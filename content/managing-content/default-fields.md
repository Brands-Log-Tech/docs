You can setup defaults for your front matter fields so that content writers and editors donâ€™t have to fill in the same details for every page.

Defaults for your site can be configured in two ways:
* Using the configuration options for your static site generator
* By setting up a default value in your *Front Matter Templates*

See the docs below for more information.
