Forestry has a menu management tool that allows you to easily manage your site’s navigation and menus from the CMS. You can find this under *"site"* in the sidebar of your CMS, as `Menus`.

This is supported using the Jekyll menus plugin or using Hugo’s built-in menu feature.

## Managing Menus
Forestry allows you to do the following with your menus:
* Add links to content to menus
* Add external links to menus
* Remove items from menus
* Preview changes to your menus before publishing
