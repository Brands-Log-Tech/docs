Forestry has a fully-featured content editor that allows you to edit your page’s *front matter* (or "fields") and *content body*.

## Front Matter
Front matter are the fields available to a page to customize it’s appearance, behaviour or content. *For example, date, title, and tags.*

These fields are [customizable by a developer](). Fields can be configured to display as different types *(e.g, text, select, toggle, etc)*, can be hidden, and [much more]().

For a full list of field types and their configuration options, [see here]().

## Content Body
The content body is an optional long form WYSIWYG body for your content. When enabled, it allows users to create long-form content such as blog posts, privacy policies, terms of service, and much more.

The content body comes with a suite of power-features that regular text or texture fields don’t have, such as:
* WYSIWIG Input
* Multiple editing modes
* Embedding images from the media library

### Markdown, WYSIWIG & HTML
The content body allows you to edit your content with in three different modes:
* **WYSIWIG Mode:** which allows users to manipulate content in a rich text format similar to Microsoft Word or Apple Pages
* **Markdown Mode:** which allows users to manipulate content using [markdown syntax]()
* **HTML Mode:** which allows users to manipulate content by writing HTML Markup


## Saving Changes
The content editor allows you to save changes to your content. Depending on how you imported your site, this stores in your content in different ways. For more information, see the doc [File Syncing]().

More importantly, the editor allows you to save changes in two ways:
* As drafts, which aren’t included when your site is built and deployed
* As published pages, which are included when your site is built and deployed

## Previewing Changes
The editor allows you to preview your changes before saving them. For more information, see the doc [Previews]().
