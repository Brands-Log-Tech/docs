Forestry has a fully-featured media manager for managing all of the static assets of your site, such as images, PDFs, text files, videos, and more. You can find it under *"site"* in the sidebar of your CMS, as `Media`.

## Managing Your Media
Forestry allows you to do the following with your media:

* Upload new media by clicking "+" or dragging them in
* Delete existing media

## Adding Media to Content
The media manager is also available in the content editor and in data files provided youâ€™ve setup an image upload field, file upload field, or gallery field.

When using these fields, a user is given the option to select an existing piece of media, or upload a new piece of media to use in this field.
