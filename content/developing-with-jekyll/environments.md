They are three unique developer environments when working with a Jekyll site in Forestry:

* **Local environment** this is your local development environment on your own machine. See [Local Development][1] for more info.
* **Staging environment** this is the environment Forestry creates when we generate a preview for you. See [Previewing][2] for more info.
* **Production environment** this is the environment Forestry publishes your site to. See [Setting Up Deployment][3] for more info.

In order to make development easier, Forestry sets an environment variable based on the environment youâ€™re in.

This allows you to set up conditional code in your layouts in order to handle paths, content, or functionality dependant on a specific environment.

This variable is accessible in your templates as `{{ jekyll.environment }}`.

The values are:

```
Local environment: "development"
Staging environment: "preview"
Production environment: "production"
```
