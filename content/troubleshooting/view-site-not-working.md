title: "View Site Not Working"
---
The `View Site` button located in the sidebar opens a new page at the URL you set in the `Site URL` setting, located in `Settings` under the `General` tab.

If this isn’t working, this is because you haven’t set up your [domain]() or hosting provider properly, or because you haven’t set up [Deployment]().
