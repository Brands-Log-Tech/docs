Are you getting this error message? 

> You don't seem to have administrative access to any repositories. You will need administrative access so that we can add a webhook to your repository to keep Forestry.io in sync with your code.

If you can't access your repos after authentiacting with GitHub, ensure that you have 3rd-party access enabled:
