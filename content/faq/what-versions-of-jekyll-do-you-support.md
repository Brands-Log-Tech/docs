+++
We really support any version of Jekyll. If you specify which version you want to use in a Gemfile, we will build your project with the version you asked for.  

If you don't have a Gemfile, don't worry. We try to keep our default version in sync with the version used on GitHub Pages, and update this page when we update our version.

We currently support Jekyll 3.1.6 by default.
