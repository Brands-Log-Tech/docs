When you upload an image through Forestry, it will be saved to the directory you specify in your settings.  When you save changes, Forestry will deploy your image to your host (and commit it to your repo if you're using Git).  Before you save your changes, you may notice that images are temporarily stored to the Forestry server until you click "publish".
