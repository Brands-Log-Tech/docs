+++
Forestry will build your jekyll site before deploying to github pages. The reason for doing this is that github pages only has support for a small number of plugins, whereas forestry allows it’s users to leverage any plugin they would like to use with their jekyll site. 

If you would like to see how to include your own plugins with your jekyll site, you can read our documentation [here]. ←- link to the post when done.
