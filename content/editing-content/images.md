Images may be added to post either directly in the main content body, or through front matter fields. 

## Markdown Editor

To add an image to the markdown editor, simply click the add image button:

[ Image: Markdown editor, image button highlited]

A modal will pop up where you can either upload a new image, or select one that you've already uploaded.

The image will be inserted into the editor like so:

`[](path/to/image)`

You can move the image, but changing the location of this text. You can also supply alternative text (incase the image is unavalable) like so:

`[alternative text](path/to/image)`

Supplying this alternate text is also important for things like screen readers, as well as search engine ranking.

You are also able to use the image as a link with the following example:

`[![alt text](path/to/image)](/some/link/)`

## WYSIWYG

To add an image in the content body, click on the image button on the top of the editor, and select the image you would like to add.
