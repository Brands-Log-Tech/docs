Due to the nature of static site genorators, forestry has two editors. What editor shows up depends on the type of content you're editing.

## Markdown Editor

The markdown editor is used to edit content. These are typically files that end in .md. Static site genorators use these files in templates to build your site. 

When using this editors, you will write what is called markdown. Most users should be fine using the helper buttons at the top of the editor to insert the correct syntaxt for them, however it is still recomended to look over [this markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) if you are unfamiliar with markdown. Markdown is very easy once you get the hang of it.

## WYSIWYG

WYSIWYG (pronouned WIZ-ee-wig) stands for "**W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**et", and that's most of what you need to know for using this editor. It works very similarly to a regualr word processor, and what you see in the editor will translate very closley to what you will see on the actual page.

The WYSIWYG editor is typically used on non content pages, or pages that aren't used by templated to generate content on the site. These pages typically end in .html, and stand on their own. There are excpetions to this rule, but this is the typical setup.

The WYSIWYG editor also has the option of directly editing html for more advanced users.
