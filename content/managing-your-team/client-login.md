You can send your client to a login page that will send them directly to a site and not to their dashboard on Forestry.io.  To do this, click **Client Login** from the settings menu in your dashboard.

You can send the URL to your client or just hard code it as a link in the footer (see below).

If you hard-code a link to your client login page, your team or client will not have to remember to go to https://forestry.io  in order to edit content.  Like so:
