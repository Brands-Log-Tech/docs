With Forestry Remote you can install your CMS with your static site.  It doesn't matter where you host your site (Amazon S3, GitHub Page, etc). All you need to do is just tell Forestry where to put it.

Forestry Remote is a single html file that you drop into your static site and it allows you to access your CMS from mysite.com/admin/. We think this is pretty cool. It’s like WordPress, but instead of 100’s of PHP files, it’s just a single HTML file that doesn’t require any updates. Thanks to Nolan who flawlessly guided this project.
