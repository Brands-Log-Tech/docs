You can add users to specific sites in Forestry. If you give someone access to your site, Forestry will send them an email with instructions on setting up their account. To add a user, click the settings menu next to your site name.

You can give them specific level of access:

* **Developers** - Have access to content editing and web-master stuff (hosting, backups, etc). 
* **Editors** - Have access to content editing only.
