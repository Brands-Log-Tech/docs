<p>If you import a git repository, Forestry will commit updates to your repository and watch it for changes. </p>
<h3><strong>When an dev pushes changes:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Forestry pulls in updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>When an editor saves changes in Forestry, 2 things happen:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>All changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repo</li>
<li>The site is compiled and sent to your host (FTP, S3, GitHub pages, etc)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Commit but don't deploy</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want Forestry to commit to your repo without deploying. Just select "Commit to source repo only" from the hosting window.</li>
</ul>
