You can add or edit your hosting information by selecting the ... button next to "Edit Content" and clicking "Hosting Info".

You can choose between:

- GitHub Pages
- Bitbucket
- FTP/FTPS/SFTP
- AWS S3
- Or to just commit back to your source repository

To choose "Commit to source repo only" you will have to have imported your project from GitHub or Bitbucket. If you choose "Commit to source repo only" we won't publish your site to a host. Instead we will only commit the source code of your site back to the repository you imported from.
