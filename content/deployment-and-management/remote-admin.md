Forestry allows you to add a Remote Administration page to your site, so that users can access and manage the site without leaving your domain.

This is great for large businesses or white-label solutions where you donâ€™t want your users accessing the CMS through the Forestry website.

## Setting Up The Remote Admin
To set up the Remote Admin, go to the `Settings` page for your site, found under "Site" in the sidebar of your CMS.

Select the `General` tab, and find the `Project Paths` option. From here you provide the path you want users to go to in order to access the CMS under `ADMIN PATH`. 

*We recommend using `/admin`.*
