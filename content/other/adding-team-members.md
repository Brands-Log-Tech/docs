You can add users to specific sites in Forestry. If you give someone access to your site, Forestry will send them an email with instructions on setting up their account. To add a user, click the settings menu next to your site name.

You can give them specific level of access:

* **Owner** - Can edit content, can add/remove users, can do web-master stuff (hosting, backups, etc) and can delete the site.
* **Developer** - Can edit content, can add/remove users and can do web-master stuff (hosting, backups, etc). 
* **Site Owner** - Can edit content and add/remove users.
* **Editor** - Can edit content only.
