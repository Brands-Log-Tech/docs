Forestry will make UI fields from the front matter of your posts, pages, and collections/sections. 

You can set up your site so Forestry will use default fields for new pages or posts. In the following example, we want all new pages to include a *Banner* image, a *Categories* field (array), and a *Description* field.

## Jekyll Default Fields 
If you want these fields to show up in front matter (and Forestry UI) for new posts, you can define them in your <code>_config.yml</code> file (see the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults">Jekyll docs</a> for more info).

In the example below, all new posts (no matter what the path is) will get these fields. 

<pre><code class="language-yml">defaults:
  - scope:
        path: ""
        type: posts
    values:
        thumbnail: ""
        categories: []
        description: ""
</code>
</pre>

## Hugo

With Hugo, you'll need to add an [archetype](https://gohugo.io/content/archetypes/) file with these fields for each [section](https://gohugo.io/content/sections/).  The following fields in /archetypes/default.md will result in the above UI.

<pre><code class="language-toml">+++
title = ""
description = ""
banner = ""
categories = []
+++
</code></pre>

<div class="highlighted-block">
<h3>Image upload fields</h3>
Be sure to include at least one page or post that uses an image file as a value for the thumbnail front matter.  This way, when Forestry parses your site, it will know to treat that field as an image upload field.
