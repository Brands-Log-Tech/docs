Webhooks are used to inform other applications that something just happened inside Forestry.io.

<p class="">Forestry can send a webhook for two types of events:</p>
<ul class=""><li class="">When your site has been published</li><li class="">When your site has been synced (imported)</li></ul>

To set up a webhook, specify the URL that you wish to send to from the settings page:

<img src="/docs/forestryio/images/webhook-settings.png" alt="/docs/forestryio/images/webhook-settings.png">
<p class="">Now, Forestry will make a post to your URL with the following JSON data:<br><br><code>{"event":"post_publish", "success":true,"error":null}</code>â€‹<br></p>

If there's an error, the `success` parameter will be set to false and the `error` parameter will be set to a string with the error type.

To give you an example, t
