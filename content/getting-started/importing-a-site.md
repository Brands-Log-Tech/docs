## Setting Up Your First Site
Before you can begin using Forestry’s CMS, you need to first import a site built using Jekyll or Hugo for us to build your custom CMS around.

If you don’t have a site already, don’t worry! We have options for importing example sites, as well as a "demo" site to get you started.

## Create your account
If you haven’t already, [create your Forestry account][1]. Upon signing up, you will be presented with options for setting up your first site.

## Importing from a Git Repository
The best way to get started with Forestry is to import your own Jekyll or Hugo site from an existing Git Repository. 

**Importing you site from Git means:**
* When you make changes in the CMS, we’ll commit them back to the repository. This means *free backups*!
* Developers can continue to work in their environment, and as changes are pushed to Git we’ll update the CMS to reflect this.
* You’ll own all of your content in your repository. *We believe giving you ownership of your content is really important.*
