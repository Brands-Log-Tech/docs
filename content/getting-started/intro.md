## What is Forestry?
Forestry.io is a Git-based CMS (content management system) for websites and web products built using *static site generators*. Forestry bridges the gap between developers and their teams, by making development fun and easy, while providing powerful content management for their teams.

Forestry powers static sites generated using [Jekyll][1] and [Hugo][2] and manages them using [Git][3].

## How Forestry Works
Forestry allows you to bring your existing Jekyll or Hugo site and builds a custom CMS around it based on your content files and configuration.

### The CMS For Your Team
Once your site is imported and your CMS is generated, you can invite your whole team and customize the way the CMS looks, feels, and functions to suit their editing and management requirements. You can even provide remote access with your own branding so they never have to leave the site.

### Your Content, In Git
More importantly, Forestry allows you to create a continuous development lifecycle using Git. As a developer, you can build your site the way you want, with the tools you love, in your own local environment and push changes to Git. Forestry imports these changes automatically and reflects them in the CMS. When content managers make change in Forestry, we commit these back to the repository as well. Both sides work in tandem, in the way that feels natural.

### Managed Deployment & Backups
Due to the Git-backed nature of Forestry, you get automatic backups and version-control for free, and we can automatically handle deployments for you as changes are pushed to your repository.

Itâ€™s a better way to build websites.

## Jekyll or Hugo?
Hugo and Jekyll are both *great* choices for a Static Site. Depending on your needs however, one may suit you better.
